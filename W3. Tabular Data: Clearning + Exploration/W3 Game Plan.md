# Tabular Data I: Cleaning & Exploring

### Before the Session

* **Download and Install** [OpenRefine 3.3](https://openrefine.org/download.html)  
Find detailed instructions for installation on this [OpenRefine Github page](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions).  
(Scroll down to the section with separate instructions for Windows and Macs.) Email Eliza with any problems or questions.

* **Download the datasets linked above** and store them together in a folder that on your machine that you can find easily. *(Note: I will add the datasets to download by Tuesday evening. It will take just a few minutes to download them, which can be done anytime up to and including the very start of class on Wednesday. Thanks for your patience!)*

* **Sign up for an account** on [Datawrapper](https://datawrapper.de).

* **Sign up for an account** on [Cornell's Carto instance](https://cornell.carto.com/signup).

* **Read** Drucker, J. (2011) [Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display](http://www.digitalhumanities.org//dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html). *Digital Humanities Quarterly* 5(1).
This article will be very relevant to both the Wednesday and Thursday sessions, and you don't need to read it all at once. Feel free to start it today and finish tomorrow, if your time is limited. 

* **Read** Davis, H. (2019). "[A Dataset is a Worldview](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-dataset-is-a-worldview-5328216dd44d)," a blog post on *Towards Data Science*, a *Medium* vertical.  
This article is about datasets used in machine learning, which is why I originally had planned to assign it later in the summer. But the theme of a dataset reflecting a worldview is just as relevant to your creation of metadata schema as it is to considering the data used in machine learning, and it should be good food for thought now as well as later.
