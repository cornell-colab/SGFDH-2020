# Tabular Data I: Cleaning & Exploring

### Before the Session

* **Download and Install** [OpenRefine 3.3](https://openrefine.org/download.html)  
Find detailed instructions for installation on this [OpenRefine Github page](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions).  
(Scroll down to the section with separate instructions for Windows and Macs.) Email Eliza with any problems or questions.

* **Download the dataset Eastern_State_Admission_Book.csv**  
-- Go to W3. Tabular Data: Cleaning + Exploration > Eastern_State_Admission_Book.csv, and click on the name of the dataset. A page will open, and you'll see a preview of the data table.  
-- Toward the upper-right, you'll see a button that says "Raw." RIGHT-click it and choose "Save Link As."  
-- Choose a place on your machine to store it, and download it. 

* **Sign up for an account** on [Datawrapper](https://datawrapper.de).

* **Sign up for an account** on [Cornell's Carto instance](https://cornell.carto.com/signup).

* **Read** Drucker, J. (2011) [Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display](http://www.digitalhumanities.org//dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html). *Digital Humanities Quarterly* 5(1).
This article will be very relevant to both the Wednesday and Thursday sessions, and you don't need to read it all at once. Feel free to start it today and finish tomorrow, if your time is limited. 

* **Read** Davis, H. (2019). "[A Dataset is a Worldview](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-dataset-is-a-worldview-5328216dd44d)," a blog post on *Towards Data Science*, a *Medium* vertical.  
This short post is about datasets used in machine learning, which is why I originally had planned to assign it later in the summer. But the idea that a dataset reflects a worldview is just as relevant to your creation of metadata schema as it is to considering the data used in machine learning, and it should be good food for thought now as well as later.

### During the Session



### After the Session
Questions to consider in your reflection post:  
* What new questions, insights, or confusions did you generate during or after today's session?
* In what ways does your project dataset reflect a worldview of your own, someone else's, or multiple other people's?
* What are some ways you may want to clean your current project dataset? How confident are you feeling about devising a strategy to do so? What else do you want to learn?
