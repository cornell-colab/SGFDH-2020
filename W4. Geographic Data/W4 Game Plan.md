# Tabular Data II: Visualizing Data (including Geographic Data)

### Before the Session

**Complete prep work** from yesterday's session.  

**Browse** the examples of maps and charts of different types linked to this page of [Example visualizations](https://academy.datawrapper.de/category/178-example-charts-maps). (All of these charts happen to be made with the tool Datawrapper, but what's important is that they are good examples of the uses of different types of visualizations, all of which can made with various tools.)  

**Consider** these questions in preparation for our discussion Thursday:
* What types of data is each chart or map type best at portraying?  
* What types of stories is each chart or map type best suited to?
* Are there any charts or maps that you find particularly insightful? What does that chart or map do that a narrative, or another analog method, can't do? How does it do it?
