# Tabular Data II: Visualizing Data 

### Before the Session

**Complete prep work** from yesterday's session.  

**Browse** the examples of maps and charts of different types linked to this page of [Example visualizations](https://academy.datawrapper.de/category/178-example-charts-maps). (All of these charts happen to be made with the tool Datawrapper, but what's important is that they are good examples of the uses of different types of visualizations, all of which can made with various tools.)  

**Consider** these questions in preparation for our discussion Thursday:
* What types of data is each chart or map type best at portraying?  
* What types of stories is each chart or map type best suited to?
* Are there any charts or maps that you find particularly insightful? What does that chart or map do that a narrative, or another analog method, can't do? How does it do it?

### During the Session

1. Discussion
2. Break into groups and makes visualizations with [RAW Graphs](https://rawgraphs.io/).

### After the Session

FYI & FFR: [Tobler's First Law of Geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler%27s_first_law_of_geography)  

Some potential questions to consider for your reflection:
* What did you learn? What do you want to learn more about?  
* In his essay "[Doing Digital History](https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29)," Richard White writes: "Visualization is a means of doing research; it generates questions that might otherwise go unasked, it reveals historical relations that might otherwise go unnoticed, and it undermines, or substantiates, stories upon which we build our own versions of the past." He's writing about History in particular, but of course the same argument can be made for other academic disciplines as well. Are there ways in which you might use visualization of your data to do your research?  
* How did the class structure work for you today? Do you have any feedback about working in small groups with novel tools? Or about other apsects of how the class time was structured?
