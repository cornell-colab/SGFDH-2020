In a state of excitement bordering upon insanity, sent for Mr. Bacon. Earnestly desiring to be chained or otherwise confined to prevent him from committing violence upon himself. Visited him immediately after. He was in a state of considerable mental anguish on account of his family and from an apprehension of the loss of reason and consequent suicide. Complained of intense pressure on the occiput and a sensation of coldness and dropping in that region with horrid temptations to destroy himself. Said he wished yet to live for his family’s sake. Was unwilling to have it known that he had been a professor of religion. Could not endure to bring a stain upon, a cause that was dear to his heart. Though for the last 3 years he had lost sight of God. Clouds and darkness shrouded him from his sight. He deeply deplored that the hope of gain had lured him into a medical practice, which had unveiled to his view. The entire mass of corruption pervading the whole extent of this community (Philadelphia) In the bitterness of his spirit, intimated that if anyone unacquainted with the widespread of sensuality pervading the higher classes as well as lower, could just see what comes under the observation of some. They would be horror struck at the vast amount and at the methods adopted to conceal it. He looked back upon it with loathing and abhorrence and would now prefer the deepest poverty to a participation in its gains. After long period of restless opposition to Gods spirit and convictions of conscience it is hoped he is brought to submit at the feet of Jesus and after some months of cheering evidence of the fact was Discharged by pardon Nov. 5th 1841 and restored to the bosom of a family he deeply loves."
