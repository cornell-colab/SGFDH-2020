# Day 1: Introduction to DH

### Before the Session

From the [list of projects](https://github.com/cornell-colab/SGFDH-2020/blob/master/W1-Introduction/List%20of%20Projects.md), choose (a) one or two of the Large Team Projects, and (b) one or two of the projects created by the Summer Fellow Alums.

#### For each of your chosen projects,
 
1. Interact with the site and its tool(s) until you have a good feeling for the project’s scope, goals, and capabilities.
2. Read any associated “About” information to get a sense of the who the project’s creators are (and how many of them there are), what tools were used in the creation, what its data sources are, and any sources of funding.
 
#### A few questions you might want to consider:
* Who is the intended audience? Scholarly researchers, students, general public, a combination?
* Is the project primarily meant as a secondary source: the presentation of original research, much like an analog book or article? Or is it meant to be used as primary material for others’ research or creative work? Or is it some combination of these two types? How might it be used to generate new research questions -- or answers?
* What scholarly decisions were made in the design of underlying dataset, the metadata, the visualization, and/or the user interface?
* If the underlying data is still being compiled, how is it being compiled? Are the creators using crowdsourcing or public engagement methods for collecting data?
* Are the project’s creator(s) writing (or have they already written) published works derived from their digital project?
* Do the creators offer their data or code for reuse by others?  
* In what ways do find the project successful or unsuccessful?
* What are your questions?

(We'll continue to refer to the projects in this list over the next few weeks.)

### After the Session: Reflection Post

After we've met, post a short reflection on the [2020 Fellows Discussion Board](https://github.com/orgs/cornell-colab/teams/2020-fellows). Address any of these questions:  

* Think about the data (or sources) that will underlie your own project. What issues do you foresee you may need to address as you assemble, analyze, and present your data?
* What are some factors that are important to the success of a digital project that you want to replicate in your own project?  
* What do you want to understand better?  
* What do you want to know how to do? 

Also:  
* Do you have any suggestions for how to do better at managing our synchronous online discussions?

Consider the discussions posted by your fellow fellows, and comment on any that you'd like to.
