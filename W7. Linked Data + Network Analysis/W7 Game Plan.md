### Network Analysis Resources  
  
Weingart, S. *Networks Demystified: 1-9* A series of blog posts.  
These posts are great because they are written specifically for humanists. Much of the network anaylysis literature is aimed at physicists, sociologists, and researchers with a very quantitative approach generally. If you're interested in using network analysis in your own work and need some theoretical grounding, I highly recommend starting here.
