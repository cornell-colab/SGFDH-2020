# Linked Data & Network Analysis  

The first half of the session, on linked data, will be led by CUL Metadata Design and Operations Coordinator Steven Folsom (sf433).  
The second half will be led by Eliza and Michelle.  
  
### Network Analysis Resources  
  
Weingart, S. *Networks Demystified: 1-9* A series of blog posts.  
These posts are great because they are written specifically for humanists. Much of the network anaylysis literature is aimed at physicists, sociologists, and researchers with a very quantitative approach generally. If you're interested in using network analysis in your own work and need some theoretical grounding, I highly recommend starting here.

Our session today was heavily influenced by:  
Duering, M. (2015). [From Hermeneutics to Data to Networks: Data Extraction and Network Visualization of Historical Sources](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources). *Programming Historian.*  

##### Tools for Network Analysis  
[Palladio](https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/). Browser-based.  
[Gephi](https://gephi.org/). Desktop softare.  
Python. A common Python package for performing network analysis with Python is called [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/). Here is a tutorial on working with NetworkX: [Exploring and Analyzing Network Data with Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/exploring-and-analyzing-network-data-with-python), *Programming Historian.*   


### After the Session  
Read [Networks Demystified 1: An Introduction](https://scottbot.net/lets-talk-about-networks/), and if you think you will use network analysis in your project, [Networks Demystified 2: Degree](https://scottbot.net/networks-demystified-2-degree/). (Read more posts in the series is you have time and would like to!) Then write a reflection post. You might consider:  
*   
* In your data, what are the nodes, and what are the edges, of the networks you are interested in? how might you tease apart questions of directionality,
