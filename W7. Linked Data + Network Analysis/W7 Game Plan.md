# Linked Data & Network Analysis  

The first half of the session, on linked data, will be led by CUL Metadata Design and Operations Coordinator Steven Folsom (sf433).  
The second half will be led by Eliza and Michelle.  
  
### Network Analysis Resources  
  
Weingart, S. (2011-2015). *Networks Demystified: 1-9* A series of blog posts.  
These posts are a great place to start because they are written specifically for humanists. Much of the network anaylysis literature is aimed at physicists, quantitative sociologists, and other researchers with (a) a strong mathematical background, and, most importantly, (b) datasets that are very different from most humanists' datasets (i.e. with less uncertainty and less subjectivity). If you're interested in using network analysis in your own work and are looking for some theoretical grounding, I highly recommend starting here:  
[Networks Demystified 1: An Introduction](https://scottbot.net/lets-talk-about-networks/)  
[Networks Demystified 2: Degree](https://scottbot.net/networks-demystified-2-degree/)  
[Networks Demystified 3: The Power Law Rant](https://scottbot.net/networks-demystified-3-the-power-law-rant/)  
[Networks Demystified 4: Co-citation Analysis](https://scottbot.net/networks-demystified-4-co-citation-analysis/)  
...  
[Networks Demystified 8: When Networks are Inappropriate](https://scottbot.net/networks-demystified-8-when-networks-are-inappropriate/)  
[Networks Demystified 9: Bimodal Networks](https://scottbot.net/networks-demystified-9-modality/)  
  
Our session today was heavily influenced by:  
Duering, M. (2015). [From Hermeneutics to Data to Networks: Data Extraction and Network Visualization of Historical Sources](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources). *Programming Historian.*  

### Tools for Network Analysis  
[Palladio](https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/). Browser-based.  
[Gephi](https://gephi.org/). Desktop softare.  
Python. A common Python package for performing network analysis with Python is called [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/). Here is a *Programming Historian* tutorial on working with NetworkX: [Exploring and Analyzing Network Data with Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/exploring-and-analyzing-network-data-with-python)   


### After the Session  
Read [Networks Demystified 1: An Introduction](https://scottbot.net/lets-talk-about-networks/), and if you think you will use network analysis in your project, also read [Networks Demystified 2: Degree](https://scottbot.net/networks-demystified-2-degree/). (Read more posts in the series is you have time and would like to!)  
  
*Optional*: Read and finish working through the tutorial that we started in class: [From Hermeneutics to Data to Networks: Data Extraction and Network Visualization of Historical Sources](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources).

Then write a reflection post. You might consider:  
* How might network analysis be useful in humanities research? Might it enable analysis that close reading alone can't?  
* In your own data, what are the nodes, and what are the edges, of the networks you are interested in? Are your networks unimodal or bimodal? Are the edges directed or undirected? If you were to measure centrality or degree in your network(s), what meaning might "centrality" have given the specific context and structure of your data?  
* What is confusing to you? What questions do you have?
